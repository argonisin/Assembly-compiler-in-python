# About
This small program was made to compile and run assembly code using python.

The reason why?:
I got super duper lazy on compiling this myself, so i made a program to automate that, and btw this entire program was made in 14 mins.

Should you use it?:
Well i dont know the safety of this but i guess if you want to just test ouputs for it then you can. Ill make a version2 where you can compile with exe and it wont run in python but actually just compile it '.exe' file for you and put it in a output folder.

That's all for now!
